These are the order of events that this Access Interface rough draft is based upon:

1. Arguments are read through a textfile - for now.
2. Threaded server is started
4. TestServerRequester is executed and address read from text file is passed as argument To Data.
5. Data receives the address, handles FLink and Aruba getLocation and responds to ThreadedServer.
6.ThreadedServer then takes these results and sends them back to TestServerRequester.
